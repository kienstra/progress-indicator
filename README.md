# React, The WordPress Way

A hands-on tutorial on developing a WordPress block.

[Rob Stinson](https://robstinson.co/) created this tutorial's block.

And this uses [Kent C. Dodds](https://epicreact.dev)' format for exercises.

## What will you learn?

How to create a content block in WordPress.

This isn't a React course. It's a course on React in WordPress.

You'll learn how to develop for the WP block editor.

And you'll see typical setup of a WP block plugin.

## What should you know first?

The basics of React and [modern JavaScript](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/javascript-to-know-for-react).

The first 12 lessons in [The Beginner's Guide To React](https://egghead.io/courses/the-beginner-s-guide-to-react) should look familiar.

## What don't you need to know?

PHP. There's only 1 PHP file, and you can learn as you go.

## Requirements

[Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

## Development

Use the correct Node version:
```sh
nvm use
```

Install dependencies:
```sh
npm install && composer install
```

Watch for changes:
```sh
npm run dev
```

## Environment

You can `checkout` this plugin to your own local WordPress environment.

Or you can use the bundled environment:
```sh
npm run wp-env start
```

That will require [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

Go to http://localhost:8888 for your environment.

The username is `admin` and the password is `password`.

For the other `wp-env` commands, see the [Command Reference](https://github.com/wordPress/gutenberg/tree/trunk/packages/env#command-reference).
